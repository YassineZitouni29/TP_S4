You will find below the commands to execute in the terminal in order to run each part of the code.

To compile and run the main.cpp file and execute a specific exercise (EXO = X), use the following command:

g++ -DEXO=X main.cpp -o main Then ./a

Where X is the exercise number you want to run.

If EXO is not defined, the program will default to executing exercise *6*.
